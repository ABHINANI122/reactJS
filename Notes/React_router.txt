This comprehensive list of topics covers Redux from the basics to advanced concepts, best practices, and integration with real-world applications. It provides a strong foundation for learners to become proficient in using Redux for state management in React applications.

React provides a set of built-in hooks that allow developers to manage state, side effects, and other aspects of their functional components. Here's a list of all the core React hooks:

useState

useState allows functional components to manage local state.
Example: const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
useEffect

useEffect is used to perform side effects in function components.
Example: useEffect(() => { console.log('Component mounted'); }, []);
useContext

useContext enables components to access the context values provided by a Context.Provider.
Example: const value = useContext(MyContext);
useReducer

useReducer is an alternative to useState for managing complex state logic.
Example: const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
useRef

useRef creates a mutable ref object that can persist between renders.
Example: const myRef = useRef(initialValue);
useLayoutEffect

useLayoutEffect is similar to useEffect but fires synchronously after all DOM mutations.
Example: useLayoutEffect(() => { // ... }, []);
useMemo

useMemo memoizes the result of a function and re-computes only when its dependencies change.
Example: const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
useCallback

useCallback memoizes a callback function and re-creates it only when its dependencies change.
Example: const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => { doSomething(a, b); }, [a, b]);
useEffect with Cleanup

useEffect can return a cleanup function to perform cleanup when the component unmounts.
Example:
useEffect(() => {
  // Effect code here
  return () => {
    // Cleanup code here
  };
}, [/* dependencies */]);
useImperativeHandle

useImperativeHandle customizes the instance value that is exposed when using React.forwardRef.
Example: useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({ /* methods */ }), [/* dependencies */]);
useDebugValue (Custom Hook)

useDebugValue is a custom hook used to display extra information about a hook in React DevTools.
Example:
useDebugValue(value, formatterFn);
These hooks allow developers to manage different aspects of their functional components and make it easier to work with state, effects, context, and more in React applications. Additionally, custom hooks can be created to encapsulate and reuse complex logic in a modular way.
